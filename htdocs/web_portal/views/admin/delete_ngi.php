                    .  xssafe($site->getName())
                    . "</a> ";
            }
        ?>
    </p>
    <p>

        <?php
            foreach($services as $service){
                echo "<br />"
                    . "<a href=\"index.php?Page_Type=Service&id=" . $service->getId() ."\">"
                    .  xssafe($service->getHostName()) . " (" . xssafe($service->getServiceType()->getName()) . ")"
                    . "</a> ";
            }
        ?>
