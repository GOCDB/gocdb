        <h2>What does being visible to EGI mean?</h2>
        <p>
            If a site or service endpoint is marked as being visible to EGI 
            then they will be exposed to the central operational tools for 
            monitoring and will appear in the operations portal. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Un-ticking the 'EGI' scope makes the selected object invisible to EGI 
            and the central operation tools (it will not show in the 
            central dashboard and it will not be monitored centrally). This can be 
            useful if you wish to hide certain parts of your infrastructure from 
            EGI but still have the information stored and accessed from the same 
            GOCDB instance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information on data visibility and for <b>Regional</b> monitoring 
            of your non-EGI sites and services, please see 
            <a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB/Input_System_User_Documentation#Data_Visibility">
                Data Visibility 
            </a> on the GOCDB wiki. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            Note that exposing a site / service endpoint as EGI does not 
            override the production status or certification status fields.

            For example if a site isn't marked as production it won't be monitored
            centrally even if it's marked as visible to EGI.

                    Scope tags are used to selectively tag data objects. In doing this, 
                    PI queries can return only those objects (Sites, Services, Endpoints) 
                    that define a particular tag or set of tags (example PI queries):

                    Scope tags are non-exclusive, allowing a single object to be tagged zero 
                    or many times. Scope tags are added and removed by the GOCDB admins 
                    while normal users can only select scope tags from the available list. 
                    New scope tags can be requested/configured. 
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    No special semantics are placed on scope tags within GOCDB itself - they 
                    are simply tags. Rather, it is up to dependent systems to interpret the 
                    implications of tagging an object with scopeX and/or scopeY. 
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    In EGI, scope tags are used to name different Grids/Projects. For example, 
                    a Site could be tagged with both the 'EGI' and 'ProjX' tags. Dependent 
                    systems should interpret this to mean that the site delivers resources 
                    to both projects. Conversely, a single 'Local' tag can be used to 
                    declare that this site does not provide any resources to either EGI or Projx.  
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Unlike scope tags, Projects are used as a means to cascade Project level 
                    roles/permissions over child NGIs grouped under the Project. A single 
                    NGI can be grouped by different Projects. In doing this, Project level 
                    roles are cascaded from all parent Projects to that NGI.
