/**
 * This script is for updating a 5.2 (pre-meps) DB to work with the multiple
 * endpoints (mep) GOCDBv5.3 data model. Follow steps 1) and 2) below BEFORE
 * running this script.
 *
 * This is a one time script that is used on first deployment of the MEPS model
 * against existing data from the pre-MEPS versions of GocDB. It is not required
 * for a new install of GocDB with no data.
 *
 * After running this script, you need to run the MEP GOCDBv5.3
 * (v5.2 will not work against the udpated DB, you have been warned!).
 *
 * Usage:
 * ======
 *
 * 1) Update DB tables
 * ====================
 * Before running this script, you MUST update the DB schema to correspond to the
 * 5.3 mep Doctrine entity model. This can be done using the following Doctrine
 * commands on the command line:
 *
 * // 1.1) Test you can run the schema-tool on the command line:
 *  $doctrine orm:schema-tool:update --help
 *
 * // 1.2) View what DB schema changes would occur without actually updating the DB:
 * $doctrine orm:schema-tool:update --dump-sql
 *     ...SQL DDL statemetns will be printed here...
 *
 * // 1.3) Update the DB schema using force (or copy the DDL as printed above and run manually):
 * $doctrine orm:schema-tool:update --force
 *     Updating database schema...
 *     Database schema updated successfully! "n" queries were executed
 *
 *
 * 2) Run this script
 * ====================
 * // 2.1) Cd into '<GOCDB_SRC_HOME>/lib/Doctrine/versionUpdateScripts'
 *
 * // 2.2) Run this script on the command line using:
 * $php MEPS_update_scriptRunner.php --force
 *
 *
 * The script does the following:
 * a. Copies up the URL field from each service's single EndpointLocation entity
 *    up to the service entity's url field.
 * b. For each Downtime create a new link to the affected service and remove the join
 *    between the downtime and the endpoint
 *    Then unlink the EndpointLocation from the downtime so only the Service-Downtime link remains.
 * c. Finally all endpoints are unlinked from their parent services and deleted
 *    to allow the MEPS model to be used correctly in the future.
