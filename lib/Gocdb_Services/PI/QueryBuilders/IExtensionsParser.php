     * Parse the given extensions query string and return a tokenised array.
     * <p>
     * The format of the string is one or more <code>AND_OR_NOT_OPERATOR(key=value)</code> groups.
     * <p>
     * The format of the query string must be as follows:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>For each group the AND_OR_NOT_OPERATOR is optional, but if specified must be one of
     *      <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code> or <code>NOT</code>.</li>
     *   <li>The key=value must be enclosed with a leading and trailing parenthesis.</li>
     *   <li>The key=value string must contain one or more equals '=' chars
     *   (the string is split on the first equals char moving from left to right)</li>
     *   <li>The rules for allowed chars in the 'key' and 'value' parts are
     *   defined by the implementation.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The format of the returned array is a two dimensional array. Each nested
     * array has two elements, the first being an operator string, the second
     * being the formatted key=value string.  If the query
     * string does not define a leading operator, <code>AND</code> is assumed.
     * For subsequent groups, if no OPERATOR is defined, then the last
     * encountered operator is used to populate the nested array element.
     * <p>
     * Each key=value string value is formatted as follows:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>The leading/trailing parenthesis are stripped off.</li>
     *   <li>Backslashes are stripped out: (\' becomes ' and so on) while
     *   double backslashes (\\) are made into a single backslash (\)
     *   (<code>stripslashes($string)</code> is appled to each value) </li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * Given the expression <code>(VO=Alice)(VO=Atlas)NOT(VO=LHCB)(VO=AAA)OR(VO=BBB)</code>
     * the following array is returned:
     * <code>
     *    Array
     *    (
     *        [0] => Array
     *            (
     *                [0] => AND
     *                [1] => VO=Alice
     *            )
     *        [1] => Array
     *            (
     *                [0] => AND
     *                [1] => VO=Atlas
     *            )
     *        [2] => Array
     *            (
     *                [0] => NOT
     *                [1] => VO=LHCB
     *            )
     *        [3] => Array
     *            (
     *                [0] => NOT
     *                [1] => VO=AAA
