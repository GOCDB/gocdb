        Specify a list of RESERVED scope tag names: 
        - New Reserved tags can only be directly assigned to resources by the gocdb-admins 
         (resources include NGIs, Sites, Services, SGs but not Projects - don't currently need to tag projects) 
        - When creating a new child resource (e.g. a child Site or child Service), 
          the scopes that are assigned to the parent are automatically inherited and assigned to the child.  
        - Reserved tags assigned to a resource are optional.   
        - Users can reapply Reserved tags to a resource ONLY if the tag can be 
          inherited from the parent ScopedEntity (parents include NGIs/Sites).
        - For Sites: If a Reserved tag is removed from a Site, then the same tag is also removed
          from all the child services - a Service can't have a reserved tag that 
          is not supported by its parent Site. 
        - For NGIs: If a Reserved tag is removed from an NGI, then the same tag is NOT 
          removed from all the child Sites - this is intentionally different from the Site->Service relationship.
