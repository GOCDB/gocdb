    Document   : truncateDataTablesNoSeed.xml
    Author     : David Meredith
    Description:
        This dbunit seed file is used to clean and seed selected tables in the test db.
        With the default operation of CLEAN_INSERT, you can specify that you
        want to TRUNCATE a table and not insert any values by listing that
        table as an element without any attributes (to ensure an empty table).
        
        Impt: You can specify DELETE_ALL rather than TRUNCATE in your fixture (see getSetUpOperation())
        to issue a DELETE from <table> which is more portable than a 
        TRUNCATE table <table> (some DBs require high privileges for truncate statements 
        and also do not allow truncates across tables with FK contstraints e.g. Oracle). 
        
        Ordering of the table elements below is SIGNIFICANT. You must consider
        foreign key constraints when deleting data from tables. When 
        DELETE_ALL is used, the order of the tables below is read in REVERSE
        by phpunit (so the last table specified is truncated/delete_all first). 
        
        Therefore, entities that hold/own the FKs must be deleted FIRST, e.g. 
        Site has many Services, therefore since Services holds 
        the FK (as it is on the 'many' side), this table MUST be cleared before Site ! 
        
        The most common reason you would want to ensure an empty table as
        a part of your fixture is when your test should be inserting data to
        that table.
